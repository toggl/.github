## ðŸ˜Ž A bit about Toggl

- [Toggl](http://toggl.com) is the brand behind three beloved tools for making life easier at work: [Toggl Track](http://toggl.com/track), [Toggl Plan](http://toggl.com/plan), and [Toggl Hire](http://toggl.com/hire). Trust and respect are our key values, shared across all the teams behind the tools.
- We build tools that helps teams do their best work by being effective, empowering, and effortless. This means our tools help users take care of tedious administrative tasks so that they spend their time on work that matters.
- We stand strongly against [employee surveillance](https://toggl.com/track/anti-surveillance-statement/); we donâ€™t monitor employees internally and we donâ€™t implement features in any of our tools to help companies spy on theirs.
- We have over a million **active** users across all Toggl products.

## ðŸ‘€Â Whatâ€™s it like to work here?

- **Weâ€™ve been fully remote since 2014.** We hire globally and you work from wherever you want, as long as you have access to good internet!
- **We put freedom first.** We don't believe in a fixed 9-5 work schedule. It doesn't matter when or how you work, as long as you get things done. We call this **R**esults and **A**ccountability **F**irst at **T**oggl, or [RAFT](https://toggl.com/blog/work-culture-at-toggl).
- **We donâ€™t shy away from challenges.** Being remote means we get to hire world-class people. Youâ€™ll work together with the best peopleâ€”each with their unique skillset and perspectiveâ€”to tackle real problems.
- **Weâ€™re always innovating.** We are curious and continuously experiment and iterate to work smarter, not harder.
- **We work async.** Weâ€™re a remote company, so all of our meetings happen virtually over **Zoom**. But weâ€™re also spread out across multiple time zones, so we rely a lot on **Slack** and **Notion** for daily communication and documentation. We also host three team meetups yearly.
